# Just a simple study using pygame and pyaudio
Dependecies:
- pyaudio
- audioop
- pygame

## If you want to use this:
Change the images but keep the names, if you know python and a little of pygame you can modify the code to suit the size, the default is a screen of 480x480 with each image being 128x128 scaled as 2x by the pygame "transform.scale2x".
